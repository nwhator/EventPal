## Technologies

### Frontend Technologies:

1. **React.js:**
   - *Reasoning:* React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and helps in managing complex UI structures.

2. **Tailwind CSS:**
   - *Reasoning:* Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines styling with pre-built classes, making it beginner-friendly and efficient for rapid development.

     - *Alternative Option: Bootstrap*
       - *Trade-offs:* Bootstrap is another widely used CSS framework that provides more pre-designed components, which can be advantageous for faster prototyping. However, Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for greater customization and a smaller overall file size.

       - *Final Decision:* We opted for Tailwind CSS due to its simplicity and flexibility, providing a balance between ease of use for beginners and the customization needed for our project.

### Backend Technologies:

1. **Node.js with Express.js:**
   - *Reasoning:* Node.js enables server-side JavaScript development, and Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework. This combination aligns well with our frontend technology choices, fostering a unified JavaScript stack.

2. **Database - MongoDB:**
   - *Reasoning:* MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its ease of use and scalability. Its JSON-like documents and flexibility suit the dynamic nature of our project's data.

     - *Alternative Option: PostgreSQL*
       - *Trade-offs:* PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database with extensive features for complex data relationships. However, for our MVP, the flexibility of MongoDB for handling diverse data types was deemed more fitting.

       - *Final Decision:* We chose MongoDB for its simplicity, better alignment with our initial data structure, and ease of integration with Node.js.

### Version Control and Collaboration:

1. **Git (GitHub):**
   - *Reasoning:* Git is the standard version control system, and GitHub provides a collaborative platform for managing repositories, issues, and pull requests.

### Communication:

1. **WhatsApp and Google Meet:**
   - *Reasoning:* WhatsApp allows quick and informal communication, while Google Meet facilitates scheduled and structured meetings. These tools ensure effective team collaboration.

### Deployment:

1. **Heroku:**
   - *Reasoning:* Heroku is a cloud platform that simplifies deployment. Its ease of use and integration with Git make it suitable for quick deployment of our MVP.

### Learning Resources:

1. **Online Documentation and Tutorials:**
   - *Reasoning:* Utilizing online resources, documentation, and tutorials for React.js, Node.js, and other technologies is essential for continuous learning and problem-solving.

These technology choices were made considering the beginner level of our team and the need for simplicity and efficiency. Regular team discussions and the desire for a unified JavaScript stack influenced these decisions, ensuring a cohesive and manageable development process for our EventPal project.

## Challenge

### Problem Statement:

The Portfolio Project aims to address the challenges and complexities associated with event planning. Organizing events, whether they be corporate conferences, weddings, or small gatherings, often involves a multitude of tasks such as guest list management, vendor coordination, budgeting, and timeline creation. The lack of a centralized and streamlined solution can lead to stress and inefficiencies in the planning process.

### What the Portfolio Project Will Solve:

1. **Centralized Event Planning:**
   - The project will provide an all-in-one platform, EventPal, to simplify and streamline the event planning process. This includes features for guest list management, vendor coordination, budgeting, and timeline creation.

2. **Reduced Stress and Chaos:**
   - EventPal aims to eliminate the stress and chaos associated with event planning, offering a cohesive and enjoyable experience for organizers.

### What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve:

1. **External Factors:**
   - The project will not address external factors such as unpredictable weather, sudden cancellations from vendors, or unforeseen circumstances that might affect events.

2. **Event Execution:**
   - While EventPal aids in the planning phase, it does not directly manage the execution of events. The focus is on the pre-event organization and coordination aspects.

### Intended Users:

The Portfolio Project will benefit event organizers across various domains, including:
- Corporate event planners
- Wedding organizers
- Social event coordinators
- Individuals planning private gatherings

### Relevance to Locale:

The Portfolio Project is not inherently dependent on a specific locale. However, certain features, such as vendor recommendations or local regulations related to events, can be customized based on the specific needs and regulations of different regions. EventPal is designed to be versatile and adaptable to various locales, ensuring its relevance across different event planning scenarios globally.

## Risks

### Technical Risks:

1. **Integration Challenges:**
   - *Potential Impact:* Difficulties in integrating different technologies (React.js, Node.js, MongoDB) might arise, leading to delays in development.
   - *Safeguards/Alternatives:* Regular communication and collaboration among team members, along with thorough testing during the development process, will mitigate integration challenges. Additionally, seeking assistance from online communities and resources can provide solutions to specific technical issues.

2. **Scalability Issues:**
   - *Potential Impact:* As the project grows, scalability issues with the chosen technologies might emerge.
   - *Safeguards/Alternatives:* Designing the architecture with scalability in mind, utilizing best practices, and periodically reviewing the system's performance will help identify and address scalability concerns. If needed, alternative technologies or optimizations can be explored.

3. **Limited Experience:**
   - *Potential Impact:* The team's limited experience with certain technologies might lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal coding practices.
   - *Safeguards/Alternatives:* Investing time in learning and training sessions, leveraging online tutorials, and seeking guidance from experienced developers can help the team build proficiency with the technologies used in the project.

### Non-Technical Risks:

1. **Communication Breakdown:**
   - *Potential Impact:* Ineffective communication within the team could result in misunderstandings, delays, or misaligned goals.
   - *Strategies for Prevention:* Regular team meetings, clear documentation, and the use of communication tools like WhatsApp and Google Meet will foster open communication. Establishing a feedback loop and addressing concerns promptly will help prevent breakdowns.

2. **Scope Creep:**
   - *Potential Impact:* The project scope expanding beyond the defined boundaries may lead to missed deadlines and increased workload.
   - *Strategies for Prevention:* Clearly defining project milestones, setting realistic expectations, and regularly reassessing project goals will help prevent scope creep. Any proposed changes should undergo thorough evaluation before implementation.

3. **Team Member Availability:**
   - *Potential Impact:* Unforeseen circumstances leading to team members being unavailable could impact project timelines.
   - *Strategies for Prevention:* Cross-training team members on critical tasks, maintaining clear documentation, and having contingency plans in place will help mitigate the impact of sudden unavailability.
